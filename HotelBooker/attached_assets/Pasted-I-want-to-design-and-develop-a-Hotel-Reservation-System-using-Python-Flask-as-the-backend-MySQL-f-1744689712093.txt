I want to design and develop a Hotel Reservation System using Python (Flask) as the backend, MySQL for the database, and HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for the frontend.

🔧 Project Requirements:
The system should provide functionality for customers to:

Browse room availability based on date range and room type

Book rooms by selecting room type, dates, and number of guests

View and manage existing reservations

Track stay duration, check-in/check-out dates

See room pricing and receive a final billing amount

Process payments (simulate with status field or integrate a payment gateway if needed)

The system should provide functionality for administrators to:

Manage room inventory (add/edit/delete rooms, update room status or pricing)

Manage check-ins and check-outs

View and manage all customer bookings

Generate reports on:

Occupancy rates (daily/weekly/monthly)

Booking statistics (e.g., peak seasons)

Revenue (filtered by time/date)

The MySQL database schema should include tables such as:

Rooms (room_id, room_number, type, price_per_night, status)

Customers (customer_id, name, email, phone)

Reservations (reservation_id, customer_id, room_id, check_in_date, check_out_date, num_guests, total_price, payment_status)

Admins (admin_id, name, email, password_hash)

Payments (payment_id, reservation_id, payment_date, amount, payment_method, payment_status)

The Flask backend should support:

Viewing available rooms by date range and type

Creating, updating, and canceling reservations

Performing check-in and check-out actions

Generating admin-level reports

Basic payment simulation or integration

The frontend UI should include:

Customer views: room listings, booking forms, reservation status

Admin dashboard: overview cards (occupancy, revenue), room and booking management

Forms with Bootstrap styling and JavaScript date pickers

Organize the application using:

Use mysql-connector-python (or SQLAlchemy) for connecting Flask with MySQL and maintain modular, readable code.

🔐 Optional Features:
User authentication system (Flask-Login or sessions) for customers and admin

Email confirmation for bookings (optional)

Payment gateway simulation (status update, mock transaction IDs)

📦 Deliverables:
SQL database schema with all foreign keys and constraints

Flask app with full backend routing for customers and admins

Frontend templates for booking flow and admin panel

Optional login/auth system with role-based access

Reporting modules for occupancy and revenue
